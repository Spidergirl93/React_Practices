# Testing in React.js

This repository is a simple application with some very simple components which has been tested using Jest. This is just a beginning to test the functionality of different elements in components and also asynchronouse methods using mock data. I may return and work on this repo a bit more later but for now, it stays simple.

There is no demo since the code itself is the point (at least for now).
